Syntax: grep [options] PATTERN [file] Options:

-w 				Forces PATTERN to match whole words only 
-x 				Forces PATTERN to match whole lines only 
-E 				Makes PATTERN an extended regular expression 
-f 				Obtains PATTERN from a file
-v 				Inverts the match (prints nonmatching lines) 
-m [NUM] 		Stops after NUM matches
-R 				Acts recursively when searching through directories
â€”color=[WHEN] 	Displays output in color; WHEN is always, auto, or never

Metacharacters:

[ ]				Matches anything inside the brackets, either individually or as a whole, including letters or
				numbers. Be aware that lower- and uppercase letters are different.
-				Creates a range; for example, one through nine would be 1-9. This dash can also be used to search for 
				a range of letters such as a-z or A-Z. There are no spaces between characters when using a range.

^				Negates a search when used inside brackets. The caret is used outside brackets to find only lines 
				that begin with a given string.
$				Similar to a caret outside brackets, finds lines based on their ending character or string.
.				Finds any character in its position.
*				Matches any character zero or more times.
( ) 			Combines multiple patterns.
|				Finds left or right values, which is very useful in combination with ( ).
